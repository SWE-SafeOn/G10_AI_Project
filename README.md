# SafeOn
**The Anomaly Detection Framework for Smart Home IoT Security With Digtal Twin**

---

## Project Proposal
The Internet of Things (IoT) has rapidly transformed modern homes into highly connected environments, integrating devices such as cameras, smart locks, vacuum robots, and household appliances.

In this study, we propose a smart home security framework based on an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) approach rule-based detection, and machine learning techniques such as IsolationForest for instant anomalies and LSTM for temporal behavioral analysis.

The system provides real-time alerts, logs forensic evidence, and demonstrates a practical, privacy-preserving approach to safeguarding IoT devices in everyday home environments.

Through SafeOn, we can make a practical, scalable, and privacy-conscious approach to securing IoT devices against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.
